Brief Description
- For this case study, our group is assigned to create a bus booking system written in php programming language. 
- This system allows the user to select their destination, origin, date, bus operator, time and seat number.
- There are two types of seats , double (aisle and window), both cost RM21 while single seat costs RM25.
